To create a new subfolder, you're going to add a new file in your base repository. In the field above where it asks for a new filename, put your folder name and then a /, 
which will tell Github you want a new folder there. Then finish the filename to create README.md (this file) and put your basic who-what-when-where-why info here. Hit the 
green commit button and then you can upload new files directly to the newly-created folder.

To create a new subfolder, go back up to your base directory and repeat the process.
